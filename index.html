<p>Thanks a lot of visiting! My name is bryan liu, and I'm from the greater Seattle area. Currently, I am a first year college student at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo (SLO). If you are looking for some college advice, some fun facts about me, or just some programs (designed by me) to play with, you have come to the right place(: (programs coming soon so check back often!)</p>

<b>Shooting of Ahmaud Arbery 05/08/2020</b>
<p>In a few days I am planning on incorporating a morning run in my daily schdule. Should I be wary and make sure I social distance myself from others? Yes. Do I have to worry about getting shot because of who I am or my skin color? No. This is what priveledge looks like in one of its most obvious entities.</p>

<p>Priveledge comes in many forms. In my case, I am priveledged because I am in a family that makes an income far above poverty line, I came from a rich, safe, and sheltered neighborhood, I am of lighter skin color, I am male, I am not part of the LGBTQ, I have the opportunity to go to college, and the list goes on and on. The matter of the fact is that many others are not as fortunate. People of darker skin color go through much more prejudice from others than a person of ligher skin color, like me, could ever understand. People who identify as the opposite sex, and gay/lesbian people go through a lot more hardships than a straight person, like me, could ever understand.</p>

<p>What is the point of me saying all this? The point I am making is that I still see many people today, many of which I go to school with, jokingly saying the "N" word "for fun" (why that word is so funny to some people is beyond me), jokingly throwing the word "faggot" around, jokingly saying that their midterm "raped" them, and many other derogatory remarks/hate speech towards a different demographic.</p>

<p>We need to wake up. We need to stop tolerating these inappropraite comments. I know we cannot end racism/sexism/homophobia in a day, a month, or perhaps, ever. However, by actively calling out and admonishing those who perpetuate these derogatory remarks, we can make it a thing of the past.</p>

<p>It is all about the small steps. Recognizing the prejudice in yourself, not ignoring the casual use of derogatory terms, understanding the hardships others have that you don't.</p>  
<p>Calling your own friends (and maybe even family members) out for saying something they should not say will feel uncomfortable. It may also make you look like the person who is trying to "ruin the fun". But I gurantee you, if we all start doing this, we will see a beautiful image emerge in our unperfect nation.</p>


<b>"Murder hornets" making its way to 'Merica</b>
<b>05/02/2020</b>

<p>I and many others did not really think 2020 could get any worse... but it has. Murder hornets are coming to 'Merica. First spotted in the state of Washington, these hornets are huge. Like, really big. Costco size. A couple stings from these f***ing pests and you are pretty much done. I guess the best thing we can do is let the animal specialists take care of them, but I am not sure how they are going to kill off the entire species. Man... this year really does make me feel like I am in a Black Mirror episode.</p>

<b>COVID-19</b>
<b>04/29/2020</b>

<p>As of the writing of this article, April 29, COVID-19 has shown no signs of stopping any time soon. Whether or not classes at Cal Poly and other universities across the nation will be held virtual is still in question. CSU Fullerton was rumored to hold fall courses entirely virtual (this rumor actually was not true, CSUF only planned for that to be the case), the University of California- San Diego is wagering that it will have a hybrid of online and in person classes, and Cal Poly has given no information besides telling the student base that course registration for fall will be delayed.</p> 

<p>Starting next week, Jay Inslee is easing the restrictions in Washington regarding shelter in place… slightly. Outdoor activities like fishing and golf will be permitted. Although this gives me hope that the situation is getting better, I fear it COVID-19 will spread more as idiots start walking around the streets in clusters. My friend who lives in Orange County, California told me that beaches are also starting to open again. Let’s see how this all turns out. I personally would rather have the restrictions be lifted altogether once there is strong evidence that the situation is ameliorating.</p>
