<p>Thanks a lot of visiting! My name is bryan liu, and I'm from the greater Seattle area. Currently, I am a first year college student at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo (SLO). If you are looking for some college advice, some fun facts about me, or just some programs (designed by me) to play with, you have come to the right place(: </p>

<b>"Murder hornets" making its way to 'Merica</b>
<b>05/02/2020</b>

<p>I and many others did not really think 2020 could get any worse... but it has. Murder hornets are coming to 'Merica. First spotted in the state of Washington, these hornets are huge. Like, really big. Costco size. A couple stings from these f***ing pests and you are pretty much done. I guess the best thing we can do is let the animal specialists take care of them, but I am not sure how they are going to kill off the entire species. Man... this year really does make me feel like I am in a Black Mirror episode.</p>

<b>COVID-19</b>
<b>04/29/2020</b>

<p>As of the writing of this article, April 29, COVID-19 has shown no signs of stopping any time soon. Whether or not classes at Cal Poly and other universities across the nation will be held virtual is still in question. CSU Fullerton was rumored to hold fall courses entirely virtual (this rumor actually was not true, CSUF only planned for that to be the case), the University of California- San Diego is wagering that it will have a hybrid of online and in person classes, and Cal Poly has given no information besides telling the student base that course registration for fall will be delayed.</p> 

<p>Starting next week, Jay Inslee is easing the restrictions in Washington regarding shelter in place… slightly. Outdoor activities like fishing and golf will be permitted. Although this gives me hope that the situation is getting better, I fear it COVID-19 will spread more as idiots start walking around the streets in clusters. My friend who lives in Orange County, California told me that beaches are also starting to open again. Let’s see how this all turns out. I personally would rather have the restrictions be lifted altogether once there is strong evidence that the situation is ameliorating.</p>
