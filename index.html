	<p>Thanks for stopping by! I am currently a first year at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo (SLO) majoring in applied math with a computer science concentration, and minoring in physics.</p> 

	<h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Bellevue, Washington: </p>
        <p>I moved to Bellevue, Washington when I was five and attended kindergarten through all of high school there. I loved the nice city area downtown and how close it is to one of the most famous cities in 'Merica: Seattle. Growing up near the headquarters of Microsoft, Amazon, and many other big tech companies, I have always been inspired to persue a field in STEM. With any luck, I hope to create a positive impact with my code.

        <p>San Luis Obispo, California: </p>
        <p>On August 16, 2019, a new chapter of my life started when I moved to the sun bathed city of San Luis Obispo, California. Palm trees were a nice addition to my life and it was nice upgrading from the nerds in Washington to the hot girls in California. I am very thankful for the new friends group and connections I have made here at my time in the golden state.</p>

        <p>hobbies/skills: </p>
        <p>I do not have too much skills as of right now, but my hobbies include hiking, piano/violin, painting, trading card games, watching sunsets, and eating ice cream (even though I am lactose intolerant LOL).</p>
