	<p>Thanks for stopping by! I am currently a first year at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo (SLO) majoring in applied math with a computer science concentration, and minoring in physics.</p> 

	<p>I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but I grew up in Bellevue Washington. Living so close to the headquarters of Microsoft, I have always been interested in coding, because I heard it gets me popular with the ladies.</p>
